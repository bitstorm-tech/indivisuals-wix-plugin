# Product Requirements Document: E-Commerce Checkout Process

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the checkout process of a custom mug printing service. The process begins after a user has finished designing their mug in the editor and
proceeds through cart management to the point of initiating payment.

## Scope

- In Scope:
  - Adding a finalized mug design to the shopping cart.
  - Viewing and managing the contents of the shopping cart.
  - Modifying the quantity of items in the cart.
  - Proceeding to a checkout page with pre-filled user information.
  - Initiating the final payment step.
- Out of Scope:
  - The mug design/editor interface.
  - The payment processing, transaction handling, and post-payment confirmation (this will be covered in a separate PRD).
  - User account creation and management (beyond capturing necessary data for the order).
  - Shipping cost calculation and address validation (assumed to be part of the final checkout step).
  - Guest checkout, only authenticated users are allowed to add items to the cart

## User Roles

- Customer: A user who has created a custom mug and wishes to purchase it.

## Functional Requirements

### CHK-001: Add to Cart

- Description: After finalizing their mug design, the user must be able to add it to their shopping cart to begin the purchase process.
- User Story: As a customer, after I finalize my mug design, I want to click an "Add to Cart" button to begin the purchase process.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - An "Add to Cart" button is prominently displayed on the final step of the mug editor.
  - Clicking the button adds the specific mug configuration (design, mug type, etc.) to the user's session cart.
  - After clicking, the user is immediately redirected to the cart page.
  - On the cart page is a "Design another Mug" button that returns to the first step of the editor.

### CHK-002: Cart Page Display

- Description: The cart page must clearly display the items the user has chosen to purchase.
- User Story: As a customer, I want to see the mug I just designed displayed (and previously added to the cart) clearly on the cart page.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The cart page displays a list of items to be purchased.
  - Each item entry shows a thumbnail of the generated image on the selected mug.
  - The mug type/name and price per unit are clearly visible.

### CHK-003: Quantity Modification

- Description: The user must be able to change the number of mugs they wish to order directly on the cart page.
- User Story: As a customer, I want to be able to change the quantity of mugs I am ordering directly on the cart page.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Each item in the cart has a quantity selector (e.g., a number input with "+" and "-" buttons).
  - The default quantity for a newly added item is 1.
  - Changing the quantity immediately updates the item's subtotal and the cart's total price.
  - The quantity cannot be reduced below 1.

### CHK-004: Proceed to Checkout

- Description: The user must have a clear path to move from the cart page to the final checkout page.

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A "Checkout" button is clearly visible on the cart page.
  - The button displays the total order price.
  - Clicking the button navigates the user to the checkout page.

### CHK-005: Checkout Page Display

- Description: The checkout page must provide a summary of the order and fields for the user to enter their shipping and contact details.
- User Story: As a customer, I want to land on a checkout page where I can enter my shipping and contact information.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The checkout page displays a summary of the order (items, quantities, total price).
  - The page contains form fields for required information (e.g., Full Name, Email, Shipping Address).

### CHK-006: Prefill User Data

- Description: To streamline the process, any user information gathered during the design phase and the user data from the database should be automatically filled in on the checkout page.
- User Story: As a customer, if I have provided my information in a previous step, I want to see those fields pre-filled on the checkout page.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The system checks if user data (name, email, etc.) exists from the editor session or in the database.
  - If data exists, the corresponding fields on the checkout form are pre-populated.
  - The user can still edit the pre-filled information.

### CHK-007: Initiate Purchase

- Description: The user must be able to finalize their order and initiate the payment process after providing all necessary information.
- User Story: As a customer, after I have filled in all required information, I want to click a "Buy Now" button to start the payment process.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A "Buy Now" (or similar) button is present on the checkout page.
  - The button is disabled until all mandatory form fields are validly filled.
  - Clicking the button triggers the handoff to the payment processing system (as defined in the separate payment PRD).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: The cart and checkout pages must load quickly, and price updates when changing quantity should be instantaneous without a full page reload.
- Usability: The entire process should be intuitive and require minimal clicks. Error states (e.g., invalid form input) must be clearly communicated to the user.
- State Management: The user's cart contents must be preserved if they navigate away and then return to the page within the same session.

## Data Model

- Cart model: id, user_id
- CartItem model: id, cart_id, mug_id, original_image, generated_image, quantity

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- A mechanism exists to capture and store the final mug design configuration (e.g., generated image URL, chosen mug style).
- A session management system is in place to maintain the user's cart across different pages.
- User data captured during the editor flow is available to be accessed by the checkout page.
